# Verbarex Engine

Verbarex Engine is a lightweight, in-browser 3D game engine and editor built with modern web technologies. It provides a familiar and intuitive interface for creating and manipulating 3D scenes directly in your web browser. The engine features a real-time editor with a classic layout, including a scene hierarchy, an asset browser, and a detailed inspector panel for manipulating object properties.

This project demonstrates the power of JavaScript libraries like Three.js and Cannon.js to create interactive 3D experiences on the web. It's a great starting point for anyone interested in web-based game development, 3D rendering, and physics simulations.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Interactive 3D Viewport:** A real-time rendering canvas where you can view and interact with your scene.
* **Editor & Play Mode:**
    * **Editor Mode:** A full suite of tools for scene creation. Use the free-fly camera to navigate, and select and manipulate objects.
    * **Play Mode:** Instantly switch to a first-person perspective to test and play your scene, with physics-based interactions.
* **Scene Hierarchy:** A tree view that displays all objects in the scene, allowing for easy selection and organization.
* **Inspector Panel:** View and edit the properties (Transform: position, rotation, scale) of any selected object in real-time.
* **Transformation Gizmos:** Standard move, rotate, and scale tools to precisely manipulate objects in the 3D space. Keyboard shortcuts (`W`, `E`, `R`) are available for quick tool switching.
* **Physics Simulation:** Powered by Cannon.js, the engine supports rigid body dynamics, gravity, and basic collisions. You can pick up and throw objects in Play Mode.
* **Asset Browser:** A mock-up panel for organizing project assets like models, textures, and materials.
* **Modern UI:** A clean, dark-themed, and responsive user interface built with Tailwind CSS.
